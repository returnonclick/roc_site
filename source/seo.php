                    <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
                    <p>We know how fantastic your business’ products are, but the rest of the Internet might not share that same knowledge. It’s every businesses dream to be amongst the first of millions of results on Google; but each and every day, new businesses are trying their hardest to be found online more quickly, easily and directly by new customers, and this for as little of their marketing spend as possible. It’s an unfortunate truth that this competition to get on the front page of Google is only going to increase over time, particularly for industries with little obvious differentiation between their product and service offerings. But we’re not ones to say no to a challenge. It might sound unimaginable - and with the wrong approach, it is - but we relish in making the impossible, possible.</p>

                    <p>The harsh reality is that being on the second page of Google is like being on the last page; the magic happens on the first page - this is where the you get real results.

                    <h2>Learn About Your Business</h2>
                    <p>While SEO does admittedly take some time for search engines to learn about your business and will not provide immediate returns for your marketing budget like pay-per-click advertising can (after all, you can’t rush perfection), it is by far much more sustainable and cost-effective in the long run for many businesses to choose SEO when they want to be found on page 1 of Google - a feat which has astronomical advantages. Think of it like this: pay-per-click advertising is the yo-yo diet of the internet world, whilst search engine optimisation is that change in lifestyle that all personal trainers and nutritionists recommend. It’s the option that provides the most customer conversions in the long run.</p>
