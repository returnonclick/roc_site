                <h2>Information and Entertainment</h2>
                    <p>Question: If a picture paints a thousand words, then how many words can a video paint? <br>Answer: A lot. No, really. <br>It’s generally accepted that online video is going to be the future of marketing; but being the forward thinkers that we are, video marketing is our here and now. It’s not hard to understand why - as an easy, accessible format, people can satisfy their information and entertainment needs in a timely fashion. Easy on the eye + easy on the brain = easy customer conversions.</p>

                    <h2>Video On Social Media</h2>
                    <p>Video content is rife on Facebook and Instagram, allowing for accessibility on multiple devices. In fact, half of video traffic now originates from a mobile phone or tablet. That’s why we’re harnessing this trend, producing video content that is consumer driven, meaning that your brand doesn’t just stay on your website - it pervades social media too. But for some reason, this channel still remains untapped. Even though videos increase click-through rates whilst simultaneously reducing unsubscribe rates in email marketing, some companies still haven’t climbed aboard this train of success.</p>

                    <p>But we’re actually commandeering these trains, whilst our passengers relax in their cabins, enjoying an increased brand awareness, lead generation, and online engagement. Choo choo! Although most people possess some sort of video camera these days, not just anyone can create a video marketing campaign. The science to capturing the attention and emotion of a client is complex and requires years of extensive training, a keen eye for detail, and an innovative mind that craves creativity.</p>
