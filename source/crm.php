                    <h2>Customer Relationship Management</h2>
                    <p>We might not be a matchmaking agency, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t foster real, genuine relationships. Forget love gurus - we’re conversion gurus. A core element of ensuring conversions is through facilitating positive interactions between a company and their current and future customers. But politeness is just one element - you also have to be able to really get into a customer's head and understand their wants and needs. Unfortunately, telepathy is a rare commodity these days. But that’s where CRM comes in.</p>
