                    <h2>Garnering a Lead</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so this concept might sound a wee bit sinister - but we promise, it’s anything but. Tripwires are essentially the term for garnering a lead from a customer by making them a low-cost, relatively painless offer, followed by upselling them once they are spiralling down your sales funnel. It’s appealing because it makes the act of buying far less intimidating for your customer, leading to proportionately more sales than those who don’t implement the tripwire strategy - though, we’re not sure why you wouldn’t!</p>

                    <h2>Low Risk Offer</h2>
                    <p>The Trip Wire is an irresistible, low risk offer that is one of the most important steps in your sales funnel because it’s the most underdone. In today’s world, many marketers tend to rely on a lead magnet - a compelling free offer in exchange for customer contact information - in order to gain leads. Then along the way, they hope to convert these customers to make purchases through customer relationship management. But the reason why we’re all about Trip Wires is because they not only have the potential to transform your leads into customers immediately, but also allow you to breakeven on your traffic because you are converting them to dollars upfront. It essentially bypasses the extremely long conversion process in aiming to convert customers right here, right now.</p>
