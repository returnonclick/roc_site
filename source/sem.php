                    <h2>Search Engine Marketing</h2>
                    <p>If you’re selling Christmas trees, you can expect your demand will dwindle a bit in March. Given this, why would you bother paying money for year round advertising, when you can concentrate your campaign to the relevant time period, maximising your sales for when they count? If you provide certain niche or seasonal products, some of the best results we elicit derive from a well planned Search Engine Marketing (SEM) campaign.</p>

                    <h2>Keep The Money In Your Pocket</h2>
                    <p>It may sound complicated, but we promise it’s actually a lot simpler than it sounds. Through the use of AdWords paid advertising on Google - or Pay Per Click (PPC) marketing - you can concentrate your advertising to the period where it really matters, making it more cost effective for you. SEM has a 100% performance based cost component; you only pay when someone clicks your ad, meaning that the only time you’re out of pocket is when a customer is serious about purchasing your product (and no one’s going to complain about that!). It’s essentially the Holy Grail of constrained advertising, keeping more money in your pocket, whilst attracting only serious paying customers.</p>
